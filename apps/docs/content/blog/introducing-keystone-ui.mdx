We're excited to announce Keystone UI -- a comprehensive React component library built from the ground up for Tailwind CSS v4 and React 19.

## Why Another Component Library?

The React ecosystem has matured significantly, but most component libraries were built for an older era. Keystone UI takes advantage of the latest advancements:

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with CSS-first configuration and OKLCH colors
- **React 19** with automatic ref forwarding (no more `forwardRef`)
- **Base UI** primitives for accessibility without Radix dependency
- **Subpath exports** for optimal tree-shaking

## What's Included

Keystone UI ships with **54+ production-ready components** spanning:

- **Form controls** -- Input, Select, Combobox, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, and more
- **Layout** -- Card, Separator, Resizable panels, Tabs
- **Overlays** -- Modal, Drawer, Popover, Dropdown Menu, Tooltip
- **Feedback** -- Alert, Badge, Toast, Progress, Spinner
- **Data display** -- Table, Accordion, Avatar, Calendar

Every component is designed with:
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Dark mode that works out of the box
- Consistent design tokens across light and dark themes
- Micro-interactions like press feedback on buttons

## Architecture Decisions

We made several deliberate choices:

### Flat, Single-File Components

Every component is a single `.tsx` file. No nested directories, no barrel files. This makes the library easy to navigate, understand, and tree-shake.

### Base UI Over Radix

We chose [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) for unstyled primitives. It's maintained by the MUI team, provides excellent accessibility, and has no dependency on Radix.

### OKLCH Color Space

Our design tokens use OKLCH for perceptually uniform colors. This means equal changes in lightness values produce equal perceived brightness differences -- critical for maintaining contrast ratios.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm add @keystoneui/react
```

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@keystoneui/react/base.css";

/* Theme tokens go here -- install via registry or copy from docs */
```

```tsx
import { Button } from "@keystoneui/react/button";

function App() {
  return <Button>Hello Keystone</Button>;
}
```

Check out our [quick start guide](/docs/installation/quick-start) for the full setup walkthrough.

## What's Next

We're actively working on:
- More component documentation and examples
- Interactive playground for trying components
- Figma design kit
- CLI tool for component installation
