## What is Keystone UI?

Keystone UI is a comprehensive React component library that provides 50+ production-ready components for building beautiful, accessible user interfaces. Every component is designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS v4 and follows modern React patterns.

### Key Features

- **50+ Components** -- Buttons, inputs, modals, tables, and everything in between
- **Accessible** -- Built on Base UI primitives with ARIA support, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility
- **Tailwind CSS v4** -- CSS-first configuration with OKLCH color tokens and custom variants
- **Dark Mode** -- First-class dark mode support with automatic adaptation
- **Tree-Shakeable** -- Subpath exports mean you only ship what you use
- **TypeScript** -- Fully typed with comprehensive type exports

### Architecture

Keystone UI uses a flat, single-file component architecture. Every component is one `.tsx` file with no nested directories. Consumers import via subpath exports:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@keystoneui/react/button";
import { Input } from "@keystoneui/react/input";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@keystoneui/react/card";
```
