description: Download Keystone UI documentation for AI coding agents directly into your project.
---

Add a Keystone UI reference file to your project so AI assistants automatically know how to use your components.

## Download

```bash
curl -o AGENTS.md https://keystoneui.io/agents-md
```

This downloads a markdown file into your project root that any AI assistant can read.

## What's in the File

The generated `AGENTS.md` contains:

- **Package declaration** — tells the AI this project uses Keystone UI
- **Import patterns** — subpath imports for all components
- **Full component list** — every available component with its import path
- **Theming reference** — semantic tokens, OKLCH color space, dark mode
- **CSS setup** — how to configure Tailwind CSS v4 with Keystone UI
- **Key constraints** — Base UI (not Radix), lucide-react for icons, etc.

## How It Works

The file is dynamically generated from the same component registry that powers the docs site. It always reflects the latest set of available components.

## When to Use This

**Best for:** Projects that want AI context without installing skills or pointing to external URLs.

- Works with any AI tool that reads project files
- No internet access needed after download
- One file, no dependencies
- Update anytime by re-running the curl command
