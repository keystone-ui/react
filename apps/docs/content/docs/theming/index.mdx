description: Understand how the Keystone UI design token system works.
---

Keystone UI uses a semantic token system built on CSS custom properties and Tailwind CSS v4. You own the theme -- it lives in your project's CSS, not in a package dependency.

## Architecture

The styling system has two layers:

### 1. `@keystone/ui/base.css` -- Required

Component runtime CSS that every project must import. Contains hover gating, animations, drawer/tabs transitions, and structural utilities. No color tokens -- works with any theme.

```css title="globals.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@keystone/ui/base.css";
```

### 2. Theme tokens -- Consumer-owned

Color variables, Tailwind registration, dark mode variant, and base layer defaults. You define these in your own CSS file. The easiest way to get started is via the [Registry CLI](/docs/getting-started/registry).

A complete theme includes:

- `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` -- class-based dark mode
- `@theme inline { ... }` -- maps CSS variables to Tailwind utilities
- `:root { ... }` -- light mode token values
- `.dark { ... }` -- dark mode token values
- `@layer base { ... }` -- global defaults (border color, body background)

## Getting a Theme

**Via registry (recommended):**

```bash
npx shadcn add https://keystoneui.io/r/keystone-style.json
```

This generates the complete theme CSS in your project. See [Registry](/docs/getting-started/registry) for details.

**Manual setup:** Copy the token blocks from the [Customization](/docs/theming/customization) page into your CSS.

## Token Categories

### Colors

Semantic color tokens using OKLCH color space for perceptually uniform colors.

### Dark Mode

Automatic dark mode support with carefully tuned color values.

### Customization

Override any token to match your brand identity.

## Design Principles

- **Semantic over literal** -- Use `bg-primary` not `bg-zinc-900`
- **OKLCH color space** -- Perceptually uniform for consistent contrast
- **Background/foreground pairs** -- Every color has a matching foreground token
- **CSS-first** -- No JavaScript theme runtime, pure CSS custom properties
- **Consumer-owned** -- You define your theme tokens; `base.css` handles the rest
